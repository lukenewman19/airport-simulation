# airport-simulation

This is a small java swing application that simulates an airport.  The goal is not have any crashes from arriving airplanes.  The variables are departure rate for takeoffs, arrival rate for incoming aircraft, remaining fuel for incoming aircraft (which is the time before they crash), number of runways, total simulation time, and the time it takes for aircraft to takeoff and land.  

This was a fun program in part because it allowed me to extract raw data from the program and present it with graphs.  You can see what the program looked like at the end of simulationReport.pdf as well as graphs and my insights all throughout the report.
